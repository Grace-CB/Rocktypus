# This is where the Octypus primary logic goes
# we'll write a helper module from the half-built version after we set up SVN for eclipse

# Start up (add check-for-command-line-flags eventually but not right now)
#
# Load a config file (ideally in YAML so I don't have to reconceptualize that)
#
# Execute the given test the number of times indicated on the servers given
#
# Take the raw output of the tests and filter out non-error lines/info
#
# Produce reformatted reports
#
# Shut down
#
